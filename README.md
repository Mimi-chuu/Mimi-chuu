- 👋 Hi, I’m @Mimi-chuu
- 👀 I’m interested in learning code, collabing with others, and getting more involved in the coding community!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something in the future, since I'm still a newbie.
- 📫 How to reach me: I prefer to keep myself private for now. :)
